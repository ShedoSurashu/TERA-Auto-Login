TERA Auto Login v1.0.0.0
------------------------
http://blog.surashu.com/


===========================================
What is this?
===========================================
This is a simple program that types your
email and password for you on the TERA
Launcher.

===========================================
Why did you make this?
===========================================
Like all my other accounts, my password
on TERA is randomly generated so it looks
somewhat like this:

   gBi*6C6KPACzH..Z4*T

As you can imagine, that is a pain in the
neck to type every time I want to play. My
second option would be to copy and paste it
all the time. However, I found that process
to be tedious and kind of tiring, hence
this program was made.

===========================================
How do I set it up?
===========================================
Download the ZIP file from the Releases
page and then extract the contents to any
place in your hard drive.

After that, open up "teralogin.ini" on any
text editor of your choice and fill in the
information (email and pass). Save, done.

===========================================
How do I use it?
===========================================
Open up the TERA Launcher and wait for the
login form to show up. Next, open up the
teralogin.exe program and it will prompt
you if you want to log in or not.

Click yes and it should do its thing.

For more detailed info, please refer to the
wiki on the GitHub project page.

===========================================
Is this safe?
===========================================
I put the code on GitHub so you and other
people interested can review the code. I
have also included a descriptive comment to
almost every portion of the code to explain
what this or that section does. For added
measure, I even included an instruction on
how to compile it yourself so you know 100%
that the code it came from is clean.

With all that said, it just comes down to
necessity. I had a need for something like
this so I made it and thought I'd share it
with others who may be facing the same
problems. Nobody's forcing you to use it.

===========================================
It doesn't work!
